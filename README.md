# Fruit Recognition Using Deep Learning  
## A Comparative Study Between Custom CNN and Transfer Learning Approach

This repository contains the implementation of a **fruit recognition system using deep learning**, based on my research work titled:

**“Fruit Recognition Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study Between Custom CNN and Transfer Learning Approach”**

The project compares a **custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with **transfer learning models** to evaluate their performance on fruit image classification.

## 📖 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to classify images of different fruits using deep learning techniques and to analyze the performance differences between:

- A **custom CNN architecture**
- **Pre-trained models** using transfer learning

This work combines **academic research** with **practical implementation**, focusing on real-world challenges such as data variation and generalization.
